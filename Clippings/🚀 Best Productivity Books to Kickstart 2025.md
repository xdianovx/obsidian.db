Hello fellow productivity enthusiasts! 🌟

2025 just started, and I'm planning my ultimate *restart* for the year HAHA. Would love to have suggestions :D

Some books I suggest:  
📖 *Atomic Habi*ts by James Clear – loved this one

📖 *Steal Like an Arti*st by Austin Kleon – for creatives

📖 *Ultralearni*ng by Scott Young- learning strategies
