# On the process of forging evergreen notes

### 1 Making an Evergreen Note
- I pulled in this old note from my pre-Obsidian zettelkasten. I put it in a "Incubation" folder.
	- [[201502201713 Habit Concepts and Theory]]
	- it's rough and less useful than it could be
- I made a new note to work in, and eventually it became this:
	- [[The neural formation of habits are additive]]
- Now I have an evergreen note

### 2 Mapping back to the Index
- Cool but... I like to make my digital library robust with several avenues built-in to re-discover a note. I find this process of connecting to conceptual cousins further cements the new note into my memory. It sort of tethers it in place like a bug caught on a spider web. 
	- So I linked it to [[Habits MOC]], which I created just now (been meaning to).
	- Then [[Habits MOC]] leads back to [[010 Mind MOC]] which is one of my main Index Categories. 
	- And sure enough [[010 Mind MOC]] links back to [[000 Index]].
- Pretty awesome in my opinion.

### 3 Connecting Evergreen Notes
- I knew immediately another related evergreen note to make. So I made the next one and linked to it:
	- [[The truest habit metaphors are additive]]

### 4 Again, Mapping back to the Index
- Then I followed the same process as above to map this note back to the Index.
- Now my Habits MOC has two entries (no need to organize it at this point)
	- ![[Habits MOC]]


### Success
Boom! That's it. Built in creation, connection, strengthening of note retrieval, and productive/clever use of spaced repetition.
