<h2 align="center">Notice</h2>
<p align="center">AnuPpuccin is currently on hiatus!<br>I have been busy with endsems and projects, thus I haven't been able to dedicate time to fix bugs and issues and I'm really sorry for that ðŸ˜…. Thank you for your understanding!</p>

## Preface

Please do note that I've made this theme for myself, and it may not fit your use cases. However, I've made most of the configuration completely optional so that the experience remains as close to vanilla if you choose to do so. Most of the in-application variables are recolored so that your custom snippets can be used easily with the theme.
This theme makes heavy use of the <a href="https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings">style settings</a> plugin, which controls most of the features in the theme. The theme is perfectly usable even without style settings, but it's only a fraction of what it actually is with the plugin.
<br><br>
I will respond to feature/code removal only if there is substantial evidence of it being a direct copy of the original code and not just a simple imitation. (Please keep this point in mind before accusing me of being a low-effort theme developer.)

### If you like my theme:

I've made this theme primarily for my own purposes and it's completely free, but if you do like it enough to consider throwing a few coins in my hat, here's a link.<br>

## Features

### Custom palette

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-colorscheme-preview.webp"> </p>
The theme supports various palettes (5 in the base theme and even more if you use the <a href="https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css">extended colorschemes</a> snippet) which include many popular colorschemes such as Catppuccin and Dracula. These are heavily integrated into the theme as they are directly used to stylize various UI elements.

### Layouts

Anuppuccin currently supports 2 layout variants.

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-layout-preview.webp"> </p>

### Rainbow folders

The theme comes with a toggleable rainbow folder snippet which color-codes your folders as per their order in the filesystem.<br>
It's great if you need to easily distinguish between folders or if you want to make your vault look a bit prettier (Both in my case :P)<br>

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-rainbow-preview.webp"> </p>

#### Full rainbow theme

This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to the first layer of the root directory, aka only direct children.<br>
You can choose if it applies to root files as well and customise the indentation border color.<br>

#### Simple rainbow theme

This snippet makes the rainbow theme apply to every folder in your filesystem, and the order is determined by the children's place in the parent folder.<br>
You can toggle if the recolor applies to the title, the collapse border, the collapse icon and you can append a small icon to the folder title as well.<br>

### Alternate tabs

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-preview-tabs.webp"> </p>

### Customisable Decorations

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-decorations-preview.webp"> </p>
Bold and italic colors can be toggled on and off and can be customised according to the palette as well.

### Callouts

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-callout-preview.webp"> </p>
The theme comes with many custom callout styles (which can be toggled so they won't interfere with your own callout snippet).<br>
The snippet also includes support for using the colors of your selected palette which means that the callouts don't ever look out of place :)<br>
If you use the admonition plugin/have custom callout colors, they won't be affected by the recolor as it only targets vanilla callouts. However, you can make them use AnuPpuccin's palette to support dynamic per-palette theming.<br>

### Custom checkboxes & Speech bubbles

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-checkbox-preview.webp" width="50%"> </p>
Anuppuccin's custom checkboxes try to mimic the original checkbox design as much as possible, while still being optional incase you want to use your own checkbox snippet.
Speech bubbles have been provided which are useful for language learners and RPG vault users alike.<br>Custom checkboxes have been designed to match those provided by the <a href="https://github.com/ceciliamay/obsidianmd-theme-primary">Primary</a> theme for ease of migration and consistency.

### Colorful Frames

<p align="center"> <img src="assets/gh-colorful-frames-preview.webp"> </p>
Adapted from Kepano's <a href="https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal">Minimal</a> theme, colorful frames add some pop to your vault by displaying your accent color on the top-most bar.

### Simplified markdown embeds

Markdown embeds have an alternate styling with an animated variant which can be toggled globally using style settings or individually using alt names for embeds, for example: `![[embed|alt-name]]`

| Embed style | Alt name |
| ----------- | -------- |
| Seamless    | seamless |

## Colorschemes used

**Note**: Colorschemes that aren't in the base theme can be used through the [extended colorschemes](https://github.com/AnubisNekhet/AnuPpuccin/blob/main/snippets/extended-colorschemes.css) snippet. <br> **Important**: Some colorschemes have been been modified to fit the Catppuccin color value style, which means there will be some changes made to make the theme feel more natural.
